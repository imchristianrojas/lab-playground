Motivation: At work today I was reviewing my kenamatics from physics. I relearned to derived them using basic caluclus and some fundemental knowledge like v = dx/dt and a = dv/dt and a few others. I then relearned how to solve for unknown quantities in an inelastic. Through the conservation of momentum and conservation of energy. Anyways I thought it would be cool to make a small simulation to visualize these collisions and their outcomes(energy,final velocity,and combine masses)

Method: A basic sim where we have two masses M1 and M2 in one dimension. We will have M1 move to right with initial velocity V1 and M2 move to left with initial velocity V2. They will collide and stick together. We will then calculate the final velocity and the combined mass. We will then plot the initial and final velocities and the combined mass.

Results: We will see the initial and final velocities and the combined mass. We will also see the conservation of momentum and conservation of energy.

Conclusion: We will see that the final velocity is the average of the initial velocities. We will also see that the conservation of momentum is conserved. We will also see that the conservation of energy is conserved.

Future Work: We can add more masses and make the simulation more realistic. We can also add more dimensions and make the simulation more realistic. We can also add more forces and make the simulation more realistic. We can also add more physics and make the simulation more realistic.



Disclaimer: I did all the heavy lifiting of the basic physics behind this simulation. BUT i did use an LLM to visuailize this experiment.


TODO: add parameters user input parameter(mass,velocites, position, maybe accleration?, show energy and momentum?)
