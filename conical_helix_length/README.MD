# 🎄 Conical Helix Christmas Tree Lights

## Overview
This project was inspired by a Christmas tree I saw at work. I wondered:

**“How do you calculate the optimal length of lights needed to wrap around a tree?”**

That curiosity led me to review parametric equations, 3D geometry, and arc-length formulas. I modeled the tree as a cone and the lights as a conical helix, then wrote Python code to compute the total length of the strand based on the tree’s dimensions and number of wraps.

I kept the math derivation on my whiteboard (I have a picture of it), so this repository focuses on the implementation, not the symbolic steps.

## Features
- Parametric model of a conical helix
- Python function to compute arc length
- Adjustable parameters:
  - Tree height  
  - Tree base radius  
  - Number of wraps

## Notes
- The full math derivation is not included here (it's on my whiteboard).
- This is a conceptual project for learning and experimentation, not a production-grade tree-lighting calculator.
